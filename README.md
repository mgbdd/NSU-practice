# practice

Here is going to be my nsu practice project. The goal is to make a neural network on python which is going to be used in one research.
The goal of research is to identify signs of depression using facial videos of the participants while they solve some tasks. 
As i understood, they have to look at some images, recognize what is depicted on those images and press the right button.

As i said, my goal is to make a nn that will answer these questions:
1. does a participant make pauses while solving the task and is he successfull in solving it
2. is a participant prone to have a depression
